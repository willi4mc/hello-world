# hello-world
This is the description for my hello-world repository.
My name's Maddy Williams. I'm a senior Media Arts & Design major at JMU with a concentration in converged media and two minors, Educational  Media and British Communication and Media. I studied abroad in London during spring 2016 to complete the latter. At JMU I'm an active member of the TWLOHA UChapter, serving as the outreach coordinator and executive editor for 22807 Magazine. Outside of school I run my own portrait and wedding photography business.
